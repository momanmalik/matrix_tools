# matrix_tools
Python program that offers 5 different matrix tools.

These are the following:
  - matrix_stats: Determines the smallest, largest, total, and average of the values of a 2D list.
  - matrix_flatten: Flatten the contents of a 2D list. A 'flattened' list is a 2D list that is converted into a 1D list.
  - matrixes_add: Sums the contents of two matrices. The pair of matrices must have the same number of rows and columns.
  - matrixes_multiply: Multiplies the contents of two matrices a and b. If a is mxn in size, and b is nxp in size, then c is mxp.
  - matrix_rotate_right: Returns a copy of a 2D matrix rotated to the right.
  
Run using the main.py file.
